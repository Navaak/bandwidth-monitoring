BandWidth Monitoring

We use "netstat" in this project. Our chanllenge was to save our servers traffic behavior in long period such as 2 years or more. In the other hand we wanted to have them in charts for a simple analyzing system behavour. 

For using this system: 
1. install netstat, sqlite and flask 
2. put scripts/bandwidth.sh in a cronjob for daily running. It will create bandwidth.db 
3. put your own network info into the bandwidth.sh 
4. install and run flask
